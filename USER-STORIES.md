# User Stories for Second Brain

This is a log of user stories for SecondBrain, my senior design project

## Features We Will Present to Judges this Spring

1. As a student, I want summaries I can easily access for all the articles I encounter in my classes. That way, I can ensure I fully understand my readings and I am referencing the right readings when I write papers
2. As a researcher, I want to have my documents place themselves in folders (using clustering algorithms) without having to go through and make my own folder system, which takes time out of my day. 
3. As a researcher, I want to query an LLM on the documents I have read so I can answer questions that would require I read through the entire document again otherwise.
4. As a researcher, I want all my documents in one place, whether I have the PDF downloaded or just a link to the article online, I'd like to keep my research in a single homogenous location
5. As a student, I'd like all the articles I'm reading and papers I have to go over for classes to be accessible regardless of whether or not I'm on my school computer
6. As a researcher, I want papers I've read to be easy to search for (with semantic search) even if I forget the title or authors
7. As a student, I want to be able to organize my documents in many different ways and I want to be able to choose between my view of documents since they may apply to different classes in different ways

## Features We may Bring in to Expand and Develop

1. As a researcher, I want to see what documents my friends and other people are looking at. I'd also like to select documents I'm interested in to show my friends 
2. As a researcher, I want to pull up figures I know I've seen in documents, but I can only describe with words
3. As a student, I want to store lecture recordings and relevant videos in the same place as articles for my classes 
4. As a student, I want summaries of videos I've seen so I can recall everything I've seen in class without having to rewatch the full lecture
5. As a team member, I want to have a shared space for my team's knowledge base, that way we can all read the same articles and reference information relevant to our work 
6. As a software developer, I want to be able to easily pull in and find code that's solves similar problems to the ones I'm working on
7. As a student, I want to make notecards from my class readings automatically so I can prepare for exams better
8. As a researcher, I want to have my annotated bibliography generate automatically 
9. As a researcher, I want new papers in my field to show up in a feed on my page so I can see what papers I should check for updates
